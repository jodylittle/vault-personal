## FUNCTIONAL STRENGTH
> GOAL: RPE 6 | Just some quality shoulder work here to make sure we aren't ignoring any movement patterns. Loading should all be pretty light  moderate, and the focus should be on mechanics and tempo.

**4 SETS**
- 8-12 Prone DB Shoulder ATYs (Light)
- Rest 1:00

**3 SETS**
- 8-12 Tempo DB Z-Press (30X0)
- Rest 1:00

**2 SETS**
- 8/8 Split Stance Single Arm Tempo DB Press (30X0)
- Rest 1:00

## BODYBUILDING
> GOAL: RPE 10 | If we are being completely honest, this isn't bodybuilding. I really like these anaerobic intervals once a week on Wildcard - just to keep you honest. Treat every interval like it's your last. Adjust accordingly and sub the burpees for up-downs if you start to slow. We are aiming for 1:30-2:00 MAX of work per interval here.

**EVERY 4 MIN x 3 SETS**
- 16 Russian KBS (70/53)
- 12 Burpees (fast)
- 15/12 Cal Row Sprint

**Rest 10:00**<br>

**EVERY 4 MIN x 3 SETS**
- 16 DB Floor Press (Light-Mod)
- 12 Burpees (Fast)
- 15/10 Cal Bike Sprint

## EXTRA CREDIT
30min Jog or Weighted Walk to cool down the engine after setting it on fire.
