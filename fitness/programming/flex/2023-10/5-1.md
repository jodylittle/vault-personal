## FUNCTIONAL STRENGTH

>GOAL: RPE 10 | The second to last week of this cycle means we are dropping the pre- exhaust sets and the tempo. No excuses not to go heavy. LET'S GO! A slight incline means 15 degrees if you have an adjustable bench or one plate under the bench if you only have access to a flat bench. Tempo and mechanics are key here.

**8-6-6-4-4** (Rest 2:00 b/t Sets)
- Slight Incline Barbell Tempo Bench (20X0)
## BODYBUILDING
>GOAL: RPE 9 | Really strong effort here, building off the prior weeks. This is the last time you will see this bodybuilding piece for this cycle. For the rows, think of squeezing your lats so that your elbows can meet behind your back. Enjoy!
