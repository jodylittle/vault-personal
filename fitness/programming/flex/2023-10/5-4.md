## FUNCTIONAL STRENGTH
>GOAL: RPE 10 | How heavy can you go for those last sets? All out effort here for the second to last week of the cycle. Deep breath, pull hard, and get that chin over the bar. If you can't get at least 8 strict pull-ups, use a band.

**6-6-4-4-2-2** (Rest 2:00 b/t Sets)
- Weighted Pull-Up
## BODYBUILDING
>GOAL: RPE 9 | Last time hitting this combo for this cycle. Make sure you go to failure on the drop set. Have a spotter assist you if you can. The squeeze press/floor press combo is so nasty. We will probably carry that super set over to the next cycle!

**4 SETS**
- 12-15 DB (or Cable) Pullover (Mod-Heavy)
- Rest 1:00
- 12/12 Single Arm DB Row (or SA Cable Pulldown) (Moderate)

>*After the FOURTH and LAST SET, drop some weight on the DB (or Cable) row and go to failure, then drop some more weight and go to failure AGAIN.

**3 SETS**
- 8-12 DB Squeeze Press (Moderate)
- Rest :10
- 8-12 DB Floor Press (Light-Mod)
