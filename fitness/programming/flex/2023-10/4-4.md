## BODYBUILDING
> GOAL: RPE 9 | Another tough Push/Pull here that we saw back in Week 2 of this cycle. For the final drop set on the DB Bench, it is ok to drop the tempo and just rep out to failure. Let's get our pump on! Enjoy.

- Max Dumbbell Push-ups
- Rest 1:00
- 10-12 Tempo DB Bench Press (Mod-Heavy)

> After the FOURTH and LAST SET, drop some weight and the tempo on the DB Bench Press and go to failure, then drop some more weight and go to failure AGAIN.

**3 SETS**

- 8-12 Barbell Bicep Curl (Moderate)
- Rest :10
- 8-12 Incline DB Hammer Curl (Light-Mod)

## EXTRA CREDIT
