# Flex - 2023-10 Overview

In October, we're stepping into a fresh 6-week micro-cycle, which will take us all the way
to mid-November and then one final micro-cycle for 2023. We only have 13 weeks left this year, which means TWO back-to-back 6-week microcycles and then a final deload week before ringing in the New Year.
The Functional Strength section will again feature movements that we will build on week after week. 

We're introducing the slight incline barbell bench press to target the pecs, the sumo deadlift for our hinge day, weighted pull-ups for upper body pull strength, and good ole back squats for our lower body push. Get used to these movements because you will see them every week for six weeks. We will find some creative ways to hit progressive overload, and yes - we will test to see how far we've come during weeks.

In total, that gives us two upper body days and two lower body days. Wednesdays will be a wildcard day that will change every week just to keep things interesting In the Bodybuilding section, we're diving deep into drop sets and super sets. This will give us plenty of volume and the occasional chance to work beyond failure. Again, this is because we want adaptation, baby!

For the extra credit, expect a mix of delt-targeted exercises because everyone wants HUGE delts. And yes, we've reserved one aerobic session per week to make sure you don't lose the engine (trust me, you won't).
