## FUNCTIONAL STRENGTH
>GOAL: RPE 10 | Let's max out our weighted pull-up for two reps. Deep breath, pull hard, and get that chin over the bar for this final week of the cycle. If you can't get at least 8 strict pull-ups, use a band.

**6-6-4-4-2-2** (Rest 2:00 b/t Sets)
- Weighted Pull-Up
## BODYBUILDING
>GOAL: RPE 9 | Final week for this combination. For the final drop set on the DB Bench, it is ok to drop the tempo and just rep out to failure. Once you get to the biceps piece, make sure you leave it all out there! Every time you feel like your set is done, take a deep breath and squeeze out two more reps. Enjoy.

**4 SETS**
- Max Dumbbell Push-ups
- Rest 1:00
- 10-12 Tempo DB Bench Press (Mod-Heavy)
