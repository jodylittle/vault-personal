## FUNCTIONAL STRENGTH
> GOAL: RPE 8 | A little shoulder work to prime you for the barn burner bodybuilding piece. Stick to a single weight on the military press across all four sets. The fatigue should add up, and the two sets should be a grind.

**4 SETS**
- 8 Tempo Military Press (30X0)
- Rest 1:00
- 12 DB Arnold Press (Mod)
- Rest 1:00
- 100 Single Unders
- Rest 1:00 b/t Sets

## BODYBUILDING
> GOAL: RPE 10 | Just because it's week 1 of the cycle doesn't mean we don't go for it. Wildcard Wednesday is meant to be a wildcard. The max cals on the rower and bike are ALL OUT efforts. The bodybuilding movements are meant to be your "rest." Burn it down on this one.

**EMOM x 6 MINUTES**
- MIN 1 - 16 Alternating DB Gorilla Rows (Moderate)
- MIN 2 - MAX Cal Bike

**Rest 4:00**

**EMOM x 6 MINUTES**
- MIN 1 - 12-15 DB Lateral Raises (Light)
- MIN 2 - MAX Cal Row

**Rest 4:00**

**EMOM x 6 MINUTES**
- MIN 1 - 8 DB Strict Press into 8 DB Push Press (Light)
- MIN 2 - MAX Cal Bike

  30 min Jog or Weighted Walk to cool down the engine after setting it on fire.
